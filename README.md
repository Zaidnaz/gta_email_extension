# 🔫 GTA: Gmail Edition (Mission Passed)

> *"Ah sh\*t, here we go again."* — You, opening Gmail at 9 AM.

Turn every boring email into a legendary victory. This Chrome Extension listens for the "Message Sent" popup and rewards you with the iconic **GTA: San Andreas "Mission Passed"** overlay, complete with the sound effect and a massive boost to your Respect stats.

### 🌟 Features
* **Audio:** Plays the classic *San Andreas* success jingle.
* **Visuals:** Authentic "Pricedown" font with the correct gold gradient and stroke.
* **Cinematic:** A slight dark fade over the screen for that dramatic effect.
* **Respect +:** Because replying to your boss deserves it.

Make sure your folder looks exactly like this:

gta-gmail/

  ├── pricedown.ttf       <-- Download this font!
  └── mission_passed.mp3  <-- Download this sound!

1. **Font:** Download the **Pricedown** font (`.ttf`) and rename it `pricedown.ttf`.
2. **Sound:** Download the **GTA Mission Passed** sound (`.mp3`) and rename it `mission_passed.mp3`.

### 🔧 Troubleshooting ("Wasted")
* **No Sound?** Chrome dislikes autoplay. Click anywhere on the Gmail page once before sending your first email to "wake up" the audio engine.
* **Looks weird?** Ensure `pricedown.ttf` is in the folder and you reloaded the extension.
